        <ol>
            <li>Collect silk from ties</li>
                <img src="IMG_9723.JPG">
                <p> (above) I found an old silk tie that seemed thin enough to breathe through. I cut the stitches that went down the center, and removed the inner padding.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9724.JPG">
                <p>I cut the stitching to undo the folds and edges of the tie. 
                    Having a seam ripper would make things easier, but any small knife would work.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9725.JPG">
                <p>Here's all the stitching removed</p>
                <img src="IMG_9726.JPG">
                <p>After the pieces of fabric are separated, lay out the part you want to work with.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9727.JPG">
                <p>Ironing it made it easier to work with.</p>
                
            
            <li>Cutting out the mask template. <a href="Mask_TemplatesML.pdf">Download here!</a></li>
                <img src="IMG_9729.JPG">
                <p>The fit of the mask is more important than the material because you want to breathe through the fabric, not through the gaps on the side.
                    Go download and print the mask template pdf and cut out your size. For me (5'9 male), I'm using medium here, which fit me snug. 
                    Large fits me a little loose, so it needed some adjusting. The fit also depends on how close to the edge you sew, which you can see here.  </p>
                <img src="IMG_9728.JPG">
                <p>Use the template on the outer cotton fabric. Your choice of cotton fabric could be anything, but ideally you'll want something with less space between threads that is still breathable. </p>
                <img src="IMG_9732.JPG">
                <p>Take the inner silk fabric</p>
                <img src="IMG_9733.JPG">
                <p>Draw a line right before the ear hole</p>
                <img src="IMG_9734.JPG">
                <p>The inner fabric doesn't need the ear strap. The stretchier cotton is more comfortable.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9735.JPG">
                <p>Double!</p>
            <li>Sewing the outer fabric</li>
                <img src="IMG_9737.JPG">
                <p>Here, the two outer fabrics are stacked. Their outside faces should be touching. Start from one corner, and stitch to the other corner, only doing the edge shown above. The farther you stitch from the edge, the smaller the mask will become.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9742.JPG">
                <p>It should look like this aafter you flip it inside out</p>
            <li>Sewing the Inner fabric</li>
                <img src="IMG_9738.JPG">
                <p>Do the same stitching you did for the outer fabric. Again, putting together the faces that will be touching your face. I have pins holding the 2 pieces together because silk slips more than cotton. </p>
                <img src="IMG_9739.JPG">
                <p>Taking the thread backand forth like this is called a running stitch. You should keep about the same distance from the edge as you had for the outer fabrics.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9741.JPG">
                <p>Now you have the outer and inner pieces ready to be sewn together.</p>
            <li>Adding the nose wire pocket</li>
                <p>This step is optional, but I recommend it for a better fit around the nose. Your breath won't go in your eyes and fog up your glasses.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9883.JPG">
                <p>After you sew the inner piece and before you sew it together with the outer piece, add a pocket for a pipe cleaner (or tin tie). Using any fabric, cut a rectagle that's wider than your pipe cleaner. Sew it onto the inside face of the inner piece, and be sure to leave the right/left side unsewed. The pipe cleaner should slide into the pocket. </p>

            <li>Joining the outer and inner pieces</li>
                <img src="IMG_9742.JPG">   
                <p>Lay the outer piece with the outside up.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9744.JPG">
                <p>Stack the inner piece, inside up (stitched side facing you). Pin both layers together so they don't slip.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9745.JPG">
                <img src="IMG_9746.JPG">
                <p>Do a running stitch across the top edge, and then the bottom edge. Leave the sides and the middle, so it makes a tunnel going horizontally.</p>
                <img src="IMG_9747.JPG">
                <img src="IMG_9748.JPG">
                <p>Flip it inside out through the tunnel, and it's ready to wear!</p>
